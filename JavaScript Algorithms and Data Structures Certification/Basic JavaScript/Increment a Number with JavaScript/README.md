# Basic JavaScript: Increment a Number with JavaScript

You can easily increment or add one to a variable with the `++` operator.

`i++;`

is the equivalent of

`i = i + 1;`

## Note

The entire line becomes `i++;`, eliminating the need for the equal sign.

## Problem

Change the code to use the `++` operator on `myVar`.

## Hint

Learn more about [Arithmetic operators - Increment (++)](<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Arithmetic_Operators#Increment_()>).

## Tests

- `myVar` should equal `88`.
- `myVar = myVar + 1;` should be changed.
- You should use the `++` operator.
- You should not change code above the specified comment.
