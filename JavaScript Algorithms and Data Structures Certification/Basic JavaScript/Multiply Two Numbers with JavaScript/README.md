# Basic JavaScript: Multiply Two Numbers with JavaScript

We can also multiply one number by another.

JavaScript uses the `*` symbol for multiplication of two numbers.

## Example

```javascript
myVar = 13 * 13; // assigned 169
```

## Problem

Change the `0` so that product will equal `80`.

## Tests

- The variable `product` should be equal to 80.
- You should use the `*` operator.
