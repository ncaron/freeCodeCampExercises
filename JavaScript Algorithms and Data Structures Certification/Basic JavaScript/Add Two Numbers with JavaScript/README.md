# Basic JavaScript: Add Two Numbers with JavaScript

`Number` is a data type in JavaScript which represents numeric data.

Now let's try to add two numbers using JavaScript.

JavaScript uses the `+` symbol as an addition operator when placed between two numbers.

## Example:

```javascript
myVar = 5 + 10; // assigned 15
```

## Problem

Change the 0 so that sum will equal 20.

## Tests

- `sum` should equal `20`.
- You should use the `+` operator.
