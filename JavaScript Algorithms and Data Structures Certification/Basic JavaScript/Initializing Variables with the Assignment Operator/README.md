# Basic JavaScript: Initializing Variables with the Assignment Operator

It is common to _initialize_ a variable to an initial value in the same line as it is declared.

`var myVar = 0;`

Creates a new variable called `myVar` and assigns it an initial value of `0`.

## Problem

Define a variable `a` with `var` and initialize it to a value of `9`.

## Tests

- You should initialize `a` to a value of `9`.
