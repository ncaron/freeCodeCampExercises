# Basic JavaScript: Subtract One Number from Another with JavaScript

We can also subtract one number from another.

JavaScript uses the `-` symbol for subtraction.

## Example

```javascript
myVar = 12 - 6; // assigned 6
```

## Problem

Change the `0` so the difference is `12`.

## Tests

- The variable `difference` should be equal to 12.
- You should only subtract one number from 45.
